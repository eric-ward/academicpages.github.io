This spatiotemporal modelling paper, led by Kotaro Ono (post-doc, AFSC) is just out in Ecological Applications. Using spatial species distribution models, we combined several NOAA groundfish trawl surveys with spatiotemporal data on fishing catch and effort, to ask whether we could detect effects of fishing on Dover sole density.
