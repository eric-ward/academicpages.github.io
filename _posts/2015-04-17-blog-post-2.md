As part of a collaboration with some modelers and researchers from the observer program at NOAA, we just had a new paper come out in Ecological Applications. Using two independent datasets, we were able to verify common patterns in both – that populations of eulachon off the west coast of Oregon and Washington appear to be increasing. Further, we were also able to identify some areas of increased presence — areas off La Push, and Coos Bay for example, have consistently higher than average abundance. Link to paper [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-0051.1/abstract), and a recent writeup of some great eulachon bycatch work is in the NY Times [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/science/easy-solution-for-shrimpers-and-smelt-alike.html).
