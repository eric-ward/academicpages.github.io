About me
======
I’m a quantitative ecologist at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NOAA) in Seattle and an affiliate professor at the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) at the University of Washington. I work on a wide range of statistical problems – population dynamics, extinction risk, conservation genetics, fisheries stock assessment, reproductive success studies, etc. Most of the critters I study are fish, but I also get to work with data from marine mammals, seabirds, and turtles. In a nutshell, I’m interested in developing new statistical approaches to solve problems and generate predictions with limited data. My recent modeling specific interests have been pursuing applications of multivariate state-space time series and spatio-temporal models, isotope mixing models, hierarchical models, multilevel random effects models, and Bayesian model selection techniques.
