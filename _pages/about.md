About me
======
I’m a statistician / quantitative ecologist at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NOAA) in Seattle and an affiliate professor at the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) at the University of Washington. I work on a wide range of statistical problems – population dynamics, extinction risk, conservation genetics, fisheries stock assessment, reproductive success studies, etc. Most of the species I study are fish, but I also work with data from marine mammals, seabirds, and turtles. Much of my recent modeling interests have been pursuing applications of multivariate state-space time series and spatio-temporal models, isotope mixing models, and Bayesian model selection techniques.

I'm able to take on post-docs through NOAA or the University of Washington, and co-supervise graduate students through UW (NSF, NMFS Population Dynamics fellowship, etc). If you're interested in either, please email me and we can discuss some current / future project ideas.
