  abstract = {Since 1979, fishery-independent data and fishery-dependent data have been used to estimate trends in the abundance of the northeastern stock of spotted dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific. Data collected aboard tuna vessels have been used to estimate trends in relative abundance, while data collected from fishery-independent research vessels have been used to estimate trends in actual abundance. One of the largest discrepancies between the two data sources is that tuna vessels tend to report dolphin schools that are 400\%\textemdash{}500\% larger than schools observed by research vessels. After comparing research vessel and tuna vessel observations overlapping in space and time, it appears that either measurement error or selective reporting of large schools is the most likely explanation for the disparity. Comparing single-species schools against portions of mixed- species schools introduced bias. Revised fishery-dependent abundance estimates were generated using only single-species dolphin schools, resulting in estimates that appear more similar to recent fishery-independent abundance estimates. correctable in fishery-dependent data, suggesting that data on mixed-species schools should not be considered if fishery-dependent data are to be combined with fishery-independent data for stock assessment purposes.},

In all cases, fishing fleets behave rationally within the imposed regulatory structures. Successful, generalist fishermen who take risks often pioneer developing fisheries. At this stage, regulations and subsidies tend to encourage excessive entry and investments, creating the potential for serial depletion. In mature fisheries, regulations often restrict season length, vessel and gear types, fishing areas, and fleet size, causing or exacerbating the race for fish and excessive investment, and are typically unsuccessful except when combined with dedicated access privileges (e.g., territorial rights, individual quotas).

  abstract = {Many software tools available to biologists are either case-specific or require the ability to write computer programs. The learning curve for newer Bayesian approaches is much steeper than traditional approaches, often requiring an investment of several years. This article introduces a new free software package, BEAST (Bayesian Ecological Analysis of Statistical Trends), for Bayesian estimation of population trends, which requires the user to do no programming. A wide range of single-species population dynamics models are supported, including single-stage population models, stage-structured population models, and age-structured population models. In addition to Bayesian parameter estimation, this software allows users to do population projections, and may be used as a teaching tool by agencies and universities. I provide an example of a theta-logistic population model of stock pigeon (Columba oenas) breeding pairs. The degree of density dependence for this population was found to be stronger when compared to maximum likelihood parameter estimates available from the literature. Short-term population projections indicate that the number of breeding pairs is relatively stable, indicating that the population is at (or near) carrying capacity. This result is in agreement with the most recent data available, which indicate the breeding counts have remained relatively constant.},

In this paper, I review the behavior and assumptions of the four most commonly used statistical criteria (Akaike's Information Criterion, AIC; Schwarz or Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC; Deviance Information Criterion, DIC; Bayes factors). Second, I illustrate differences in these model selection tools by applying the four criteria to thousands of simulated abundance trajectories. With the simulation model known, I examine whether each of the criteria are useful in selecting models to evaluate simple questions, such as whether time series support evidence of density dependent population growth. Across simulations, the maximum likelihood criteria consistently favored simpler population models when compared to Bayesian criteria. Among the Bayesian criteria, the Bayes factor favored the correct simulation model more frequently than the Deviance Information Criterion. There was considerable uncertainty in the ability of the Bayes factor to discriminate between models, this tool selected the simulation model slightly more frequently than other approaches.},

  abstract = {* 1Management decisions for threatened and endangered species require risks to be identified and prioritized, based on the degree to which they influence population dynamics. The potential for recovery of small populations at risk may be determined by multiple factors, including intrinsic population characteristics (inbreeding, sex ratios) and extrinsic variables (prey availability, disease, human disturbance). Using Bayesian statistical methods, the impact of each of these risk factors on demographic rates can be quantified and assigned probabilities to express uncertainty.
* 2We assessed the impact of a wide range of factors on the fecundity of two threatened populations of killer whales Orcinus orca, specifically whether killer whale production is limited by availability of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. Additional variables included anthropogenic factors, climate variables, temporal effects, and population variables (population size, number of males, female age).
* 3Our results indicate that killer whale fecundity is highly correlated with the abundance of Chinook salmon. For example, the probability of a female calving differed by 50\% between years of low salmon abundance and high salmon abundance. Weak evidence exists for linking fecundity to other variables, such as sea surface temperature.
* 4There was strong data support for reproductive senescence in female killer whales. This pattern of rapid maturity and gradual decline of fecundity with age commonly seen in terrestrial mammals has been documented in few marine mammal species. Maximum production for this species occurs between ages 20\textendash{}22, and reproductive performance declines gradually to menopause over a period of 25 years.
* 5Synthesis and applications. Our results provide strong evidence for reproductive senescence in killer whales, and more importantly, that killer whale fecundity is strongly tied to the abundance of Chinook salmon, a species that is susceptible to environmental variation and has high commercial value to fisheries. This strong predator\textendash{}prey relationship highlights the importance of understanding which salmon populations overlap with killer whales seasonally and spatially, so that those salmon populations important as prey for killer whales can be identified and targeted for conservation efforts.},

Intra-population variability in resource use may occur across hierarchical levels of population structure from individuals to subpopulations. Understanding how levels of population organization contribute to population niche width is critical to ecology and evolution. Here we describe a hierarchical stable isotope mixing model that can simultaneously estimate both the prey composition of a consumer diet and the diet variability among individuals and across levels of population organization. By explicitly estimating variance components for multiple scales, the model can deconstruct the niche width of a consumer population into relevant levels of population structure. We apply this new approach to stable isotope data from a population of gray wolves from coastal British Columbia, and show support for extensive intra-population niche variability among individuals, social groups, and geographically isolated subpopulations. The analytic method we describe improves mixing models by accounting for diet variability, and improves isotope niche width analysis by quantitatively assessing the contribution of levels of organization to the niche width of a population.},

Based on our results, we recommend that conservation and management efforts in the Gulf of California focus on the two subpopulations with high probabilities of extinction within the next 50~years (Northern Midriff, Southern Midriff).

We measured total fish biomass, stream habitat, and stream pH in sixteen sites from three tributary systems in the northeastern United States. The habitat metrics included total pool area, a cover score, large wood frequency, and stream temperature. We created and compared nine linear models relating total fish biomass in summer to stream pH and stream habitat using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) analysis. The best (most parsimonious) models included pool area and stream pH. These results and a separate comparison of three regressions (low-flow pH, pool area, and these two metrics together versus total fish biomass) suggest that both habitat and stream buffering capacity affect the total biomass of fish in northeastern US headwater streams. When stream pH is adequate (low-flow pH greater than at least 5.7), physical habitat is likely to be more important, but under lower pH conditions, habitat is likely to be less effective in accounting for the total biomass of fish in these streams. This work demonstrates the continued effects of stream acidification in the northeastern US and more generally, it illustrates the importance of considering both physical and chemical conditions of a stream when evaluating the factors influencing fish communities.},

  abstract = {Stable isotope mixing models offer a statistical framework for estimating the contribution of multiple sources (such as prey) to a mixture distribution. Recent advances in these models have estimated the source proportions using Bayesian methods, but have not explicitly accounted for uncertainty in the mean and variance of sources. We demonstrate that treating these quantities as unknown parameters can reduce bias in the estimated source contributions, although model complexity is increased (thereby increasing the variance of estimates). The advantages of this fully Bayesian approach are particularly apparent when the source geometry is poor or sample sizes are small. A second benefit to treating source quantities as parameters is that prior source information can be included. We present findings from 9 lake food-webs, where the consumer of interest (fish) has a diet composed of 5 sources: aquatic insects, snails, zooplankton, amphipods, and terrestrial insects. We compared the traditional Bayesian stable isotope mixing model with fixed source parameters to our fully Bayesian model-with and without an informative prior. The informative prior has much less impact than the choice of model-the traditional mixing model with fixed source parameters estimates the diet to be dominated by aquatic insects, while the fully Bayesian model estimates the diet to be more balanced but with greater importance of zooplankton. The findings from this example demonstrate that there can be stark differences in inference between the two model approaches, particularly when the source geometry of the mixing model is poor. These analyses also emphasize the importance of investing substantial effort toward characterizing the variation in the isotopic characteristics of source pools to appropriately quantify uncertainties in their contributions to consumers in food webs.},

  volume = {Special Issue},
  abstract = {The population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering off the eastern coast of South America is referred to by the International Whaling Commission as `Breeding Stock A' (BSA). This population was heavily exploited in 20th century modern commercial whaling operations. After more than 30 years of protection, its present status remains unknown. A deterministic sex and age-aggregated population dynamics model was used to estimate the pre-exploitation population size (K), the maximum net recruitment rate (rmax), the maximum depletion level (Nmin/K), and other quantities of interest of BSA. Input data included modern whaling catch series, absolute estimates of abundance, observed growth rates and indices of relative abundance. A Bayesian statistical method was used to calculate probability distributions for the model parameters. Prior distributions were set on rmax \textendash{} an uninformative (Uniform [0, 0.106]) and an informative (Normal [0.067, 0.042]) \textendash{} and on the population size in 2005 \textendash{} N2005 (Uniform [500, 22,000]). A total of 10,000 samples were used to compute the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters using the Sampling-Importance-Resampling algorithm. Sensitivity of model outputs to the priors on rmax, a genetic constraint, data inclusion and catch allocation scenarios was investigated. Medians of the posterior probability distributions of quantities of interest for the base case scenario were: rmax = 0.069 (95\% probability intervals [PI] = 0.013\textendash{}0.104), K = 24,558 (95\% PI = 22,791\textendash{}31,118), Nmin/K = 2\% (PI = 0.31\%\textendash{}12.5\%), N2006/K = 27.4\% (PI = 18.3\%\textendash{}39.5\%), N2020/K = 61.8\% (PI = 23.8\%\textendash{}88.6\%), and N2040/K = 97.3\% (PI = 31.6\%\textendash{}99.9\%). Despite apparent recovery in the past three decades, the western South Atlantic humpback whale population is still low relative to its pre-exploitation size and requires continued conservation efforts.},

  volume = {Special Issue},
  abstract = {Humpback whales wintering off the eastern coast of Brazil were heavily exploited by commercial whaling in the Southern Hemisphere. During recent years, clear signs of recovery have been observed, but few estimates of population growth rate exist. In this study, quantitative estimates of rates of population increase are obtained from sighting per unit of effort data (1995-98) using generalised linear models and maximum likelihood estimation. The error distributions considered for the models were Poisson and negative binomial. Predictors of the number of sightings included the year, month and 2-week periods during which the sightings were made. Predictors were treated as factors or numeric variables. For the numeric variables, quadratic dependence was also considered for each predictor to allow for possible non-linear relationships. Using Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) as a model selection criterion, the best model included year and month as continuous predictors. The data indicated strong support for the negative binomial over the Poisson models, but did not support models based on a finer temporal scale than month. Assuming year to be a linear predictor, the best estimate of the growth rate for the population wintering off Brazil was 7.4\% per year (95\% CI = 0.6-14.5\%) during the period 1995-98. This estimate provides additional quantitative evidence that this population has been increasing and is consistent with the observed growth rates of other humpback whale stocks.},

We constructed a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify the relative variability in survival rates among different levels of social organization (matrilines and pods) of an endangered population of killer whales (Orcinus orca). Individual killer whales often participate in group activities such as prey sharing and cooperative hunting. The estimated age-specific survival probabilities and survivorship curves differed considerably among pods and to a lesser extent among matrilines (within pods). Across all pods, males had lower life expectancy than females. Differences in survival between pods may be caused by a combination of factors that vary across the population's range, including reduced prey availability, contaminants in prey, and human activity. Our modeling approach could be applied to demographic rates for other species and for parameters other than survival, including reproduction, prey selection, movement, and detection probabilities.},

  abstract = {Stable isotope mixing models, used to estimate source contributions to a mixture, typically yield highly uncertain estimates when there are many sources and relatively few isotope elements. Previously, ecologists have either accepted the uncertain contribution estimates for individual sources or addressed the problem in an ad hoc way by combining either related sources prior to analysis or the estimated proportions of related sources following analysis. Neither of these latter approaches explicitly account for uncertainty in source combinations within the likelihood framework. In this paper we incorporate uncertainty in both the number of source groups and group assignment within a formal Bayesian mixing model framework. By dynamically exploring model complexity due to aggregating sources based on shared proportional contributions, we can estimate posterior probabilities of alternative group configurations, and construct posterior dendrograms of group membership. We apply this method to simulated data, and illustrate applications to two consumer datasets (rainbow trout, coastal mink). Our results demonstrate that estimating, rather than fixing, the number of proportional contributions in a mixing model can improve model inference and reduce bias in estimates of source contributions to a mixture.},

Abstract
While the importance of terrestrial linkages to aquatic ecosystems is well appreciated, the degree of terrestrial support of aquatic consumers remains debated. Estimates of terrestrial contributions to lake zooplankton have omitted a key food source, phytoplankton produced below the mixed layer. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data from 25 Pacific Northwest lakes to assess the relative importance of particulate organic matter (POM) from the mixed layer, below the mixed layer and terrestrial detritus to zooplankton. Zooplankton and deep POM were depleted in 13C relative to mixed layer POM in lakes that can support deep primary production. A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model estimated that terrestrial detritus contributed $<$5\% to zooplankton production, and confirms the role of lake optical and thermal properties; deep POM accounted for up to 80\% of zooplankton production in the clearest lakes. These results suggest terrestrial support of lake zooplankton production is trivial.},

  abstract = {Hatchery supplementation programs are designed to enhance natural production and maintain the fitness of the target population; however, it can be difficult to evaluate the success of these programs. Key to the success of such programs is a relatively high reproductive success of hatchery fish. This study investigated the relative reproductive success (RRS) of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous rainbow trout) by creating pedigrees for hatchery and natural spawning steelhead. We genotyped adult steelhead that returned to a weir and were released upstream to spawn in Little Sheep Creek, a tributary to the Imnaha River in eastern Oregon. The broodstock for this supplementation program were originally chosen from natural-origin steelhead returning to the weir and in subsequent years consisted of both natural- and hatchery-origin individuals. Microsatellite analyses showed the broodstock to be genetically similar to the natural population across years. We also genotyped adult resident rainbow trout from multiple locations upstream of the weir and determined the parentage of progeny collected at various life history stages, including returning adults in subsequent years. Analysis of progeny sampled at both the juvenile and adult life stages suggested that the RRS of hatchery-origin fish was 30\textendash{}60\% that of their natural-origin counterparts. Using generalized linear models to address the importance of various factors associated with reduced reproductive success, we found that the greatest effects on RRS were origin (natural versus hatchery), length, return date, and the number of same-sex competitors. Natural parents were less negatively affected by same-sex competitors. Differential survival of juveniles and the behavior of offspring and/or spawning adults may all contribute to diminished fitness in hatchery-reared salmon, although it could not be determined to what extent these effects were of a persistent, heritable nature as distinct from an environmental effect associated with hatchery rearing and release strategies.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0022015},
  abstract = {Background Bayesian mixing models have allowed for the inclusion of uncertainty and prior information in the analysis of trophic interactions using stable isotopes. Formulating prior distributions is relatively straightforward when incorporating dietary data. However, the use of data that are related, but not directly proportional, to diet (such as prey availability data) is often problematic because such information is not necessarily predictive of diet, and the information required to build a reliable prior distribution for all prey species is often unavailable. Omitting prey availability data impacts the estimation of a predator's diet and introduces the strong assumption of consumer ultrageneralism (where all prey are consumed in equal proportions), particularly when multiple prey have similar isotope values.   Methodology We develop a procedure to incorporate prey availability data into Bayesian mixing models conditional on the similarity of isotope values between two prey. If a pair of prey have similar isotope values (resulting in highly uncertain mixing model results), our model increases the weight of availability data in estimating the contribution of prey to a predator's diet. We test the utility of this method in an intertidal community against independently measured feeding rates.   Conclusions Our results indicate that our weighting procedure increases the accuracy by which consumer diets can be inferred in situations where multiple prey have similar isotope values. This suggests that the exchange of formalism for predictive power is merited, particularly when the relationship between prey availability and a predator's diet cannot be assumed for all species in a system.},

We constructed a 2-stage model that first estimated the mean ($\mu$) and variance (v) in reproductive success from published studies on salmonid fishes and then sampled offspring from reproductive success distributions simulated from the $\mu$ and v estimates. Results provided strong support for modeling salmonid reproductive success via the negative binomial distribution and suggested that few offspring samples are needed to reject the null hypothesis of uniform offspring production. However, the sampled reproductive success distributions deviated significantly ($\chi$2 goodness-of-fit test p value \&lt; 0.05) from the known simulated reproductive success distribution at rates often \&gt;0.05 and as high as 0.24, even when hundreds of offspring were assigned parentage. In general, reproductive success patterns were less accurate when offspring were sampled from cohorts with larger numbers of parents and greater variance in reproductive success.

In this study, we experimentally test for evidence of fine-scale local adaptation in juvenile survival and growth among three populations of an invasive freshwater fish with reciprocal transplants and common-garden experiments. Despite intrinsic differences in habitat quality, in two of three populations we detected evidence of increased survival in `home' versus `away' environments with a Bayesian occupancy model fitted to mark\textendash{}recapture data. We found support for the `local' versus `foreign' criterion of local adaptation as 14 of 15 pairwise comparisons of performance were consistent with local adaptation (p $<$ 0.001). Patterns in growth were less clear, though we detected evidence of location- and population-level effects. Although the agents of divergent ecological selection are not known in this system, our results combine to indicate that adaptive divergence\textemdash{}reflected by higher relative survival of local individuals\textemdash{}can occur in a small number of generations and only a few kilometres apart on the landscape.},

  abstract = {The ecological role of large predators in North America continues to spark heated public debate. Although brown bears (Ursus arctos L., 1758) and the salmon (genus Oncorhynchus Suckley, 1861) they feed on have declined in many areas, the Kodiak archipelago is famous for large brown bears and abundant salmon. Salmon have generally been managed for maximum sustained yield in a fisheries sense, but those levels may be well below what is necessary for maximum ecosystem productivity. Consequently, we used stable isotopes and mercury accumulated in hair to estimate intake of salmon by Kodiak brown bears (Ursus arctos middendorffi Merriam, 1896). Salmon intake increased from subadult males (592 $\pm$ 325 kg$\cdot$bear-1$\cdot$year-1) to adult males (2788 $\pm$ 1929 kg$\cdot$bear-1$\cdot$year-1) and from subadult females (566 $\pm$ 360 kg$\cdot$bear-1$\cdot$year-1) to adult females (1364 $\pm$ 1261 kg$\cdot$bear-1$\cdot$year-1). Intake within each group increased 62\% $\pm$ 23\% as salmon escapement increased from $\sim$1\,500 to $\sim$14\,000 kg$\cdot$bear-1$\cdot$year-1.

  abstract = {The Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia is a dynamic flood-pulsed ecosystem that annually increases its surface area from roughly 2,500 km2 to over 12,500 km2 driven by seasonal flooding from the Mekong River. This flooding is thought to structure many of the critical ecological processes, including aquatic primary and secondary productivity. The lake also has a large fishery that supports the livelihoods of nearly 2 million people. We used a state-space oxygen mass balance model and continuous dissolved oxygen measurements from four locations to provide the first estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) for the Tonle Sap. GPP averaged 4.1$\pm$2.3 g O2 m-3 d-1 with minimal differences among sites. There was a negative correlation between monthly GPP and lake level (r = 0.45) and positive correlation with turbidity (r = 0.65). ER averaged 24.9$\pm$20.0 g O2 m-3 d-1 but had greater than six-fold variation among sites and minimal seasonal change. Repeated hypoxia was observed at most sampling sites along with persistent net heterotrophy (GPP$<$ER), indicating significant bacterial metabolism of organic matter that is likely incorporated into the larger food web. Using our measurements of GPP, we calibrated a hydrodynamic-productivity model and predicted aquatic net primary production (aNPP) of 2.0$\pm$0.2 g C m-2 d-1 (2.4$\pm$0.2 million tonnes C y-1). Considering a range of plausible values for the total fisheries catch, we estimate that fisheries harvest is an equivalent of 7\textendash{}69\% of total aNPP, which is substantially larger than global average for marine and freshwater systems. This is likely due to relatively efficient carbon transfer through the food web and support of fish production from terrestrial NPP. These analyses are an important first-step in quantifying the resource pathways that support this important ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Scientific survey data are used to estimate abundance trends for fish populations worldwide, and are frequently analyzed using delta-generalized linear mixed models (delta-GLMMs). Delta-GLMMs incorporate information about both the probability of catch being non-zero (catch probability) and the expected value for non-zero catches (catch rates). Delta-GLMMs generally incorporate year as a main effect, and frequently account for spatial strata and/or covariates. Many existing delta-GLMMs do not account for random or systematic differences in catch probability or rates in particular combinations of spatial strata and year (i.e., space\textendash{}time interactions), and do not recognize potential correlation in random space\textendash{}time interactions between catch probability and catch rates. We therefore develop a Bayesian delta-GLMM that estimates correlations between catch probability and rates, and compare it with either (a) ignoring year\textendash{}strata interactions, (b) modeling year\textendash{}strata interactions as fixed effects, or (c) estimating year\textendash{}strata interactions in catch probability or rates as independent random effects. These four models are fitted to bottom trawl survey data for 28 species off the U.S. West Coast. The posterior median of the correlation is positive for the majority (18) of species, including all five for which the posterior distribution has little overlap with zero. However, estimating this correlation has little impact on resulting abundance indices or credible intervals. We therefore conclude that the correlated random model will have a little impact on index standardization of the West Coast bottom trawl dataset. However, we propose that the correlated model can quickly identify correlations between occupancy probability and density, and provide our code to allow researchers to quickly identify whether such a correlation is likely to be significantly different from zero for their chosen data set.},

SIMMs are used to quantify the proportional contributions of various sources to a mixture. The most widely used application is quantifying the diet of organisms based on the food sources they have been observed to consume. At the centre of the multivariate statistical model we propose is a compositional mixture of the food sources corrected for various metabolic factors. The compositional component of our model is based on the isometric log-ratio transform. Through this transform, we can apply a range of time series and non-parametric smoothing relationships. We illustrate our models with three case studies based on real animal dietary behaviour. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Detection rates of these whales were greater in 2009 and 2011 than in 2006-2008, were most common in the month of March, and occurred with the greatest frequency off the Columbia River and Westport, which was likely related to the presence of their most commonly consumed prey, Chinook salmon. The observed patterns of annual and monthly killer whale occurrence may be related to run strength and run timing, respectively, for spring Chinook returning to the Columbia River, the largest run in this region at this time of year. Acoustic recorders provided a unique, long-term, dataset that will be important to inform future consideration of Critical Habitat designation for this U.S. Endangered Species Act listed species.},

Here we review previous ecological applications of MAR models and highlight their ability to identify abiotic and biotic drivers of population dynamics, as well as community-level stability metrics, from long-term empirical observations. Thus far, MAR models have been used mainly with data from freshwater plankton communities; we examine the obstacles that may be hindering adoption in other systems and suggest practical modifications that will improve MAR models for broader application. Many of these modifications are already well known in other fields in which MAR models are common, although they are frequently described under different names. In an effort to make MAR models more accessible to ecologists, we include a worked example using recently developed R packages (MAR1 and MARSS), freely available and open-access software.},

However, competition is not the sole constraint on resource partitioning, and its effects are mediated by factors including the environmental context in which species coexist.

* Colonial seabirds provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the importance of competition in shaping realized niche widths because their life histories lead to variation in intra- and interspecific competition across the annual cycle. Dense breeding aggregations result in intense competition for prey in surrounding waters, whereas non-breeding dispersal to larger geographical areas produces lower densities of competitors.

* Bayesian hierarchical models of the isotopic niche, closely aligned to the trophic niche, reveal the degree of segregation between species and functional groups during both time periods. Surprisingly, species explained far more of the variance in the isotopic niche during the non-breeding than the breeding period.

* Our results underline the key role of non-breeding dynamics in alleviating competition and promoting distinctions between species through the facilitation of resource partitioning. Such situations may be common in a diverse range of communities sustained by ephemeral but abundant food items.

* This highlights how consideration of the hierarchical grouping of competitive interactions alongside consideration of abiotic constraints across the complete annual cycle allows a full understanding of the role of competition in driving patterns of character displacement.},

Uncertainty associated with sediment fingerprinting mixing models is often substantial, but this uncertainty has not yet been fully incorporated in these models. The main objectives of this study are to apply geochemical fingerprints to determine relative contributions of sediment sources and to develop a Bayesian-mixing model that estimates probability distributions of source contributions to a mixture associated with multiple sources for assessing the uncertainty estimation in sediment fingerprinting in the Hiv catchment, Iran. In this analysis, 28 tracers were measured in 42 different sampling sites from three sediment sources (rangeland, orchard and stream bank) and 12 sediment samples from reservoir check dams. Discriminant analysis provided an important data reduction as it identified four tracers, i.e. B, C, Sr and Tl, that afforded more than 97\% correct assignations in discriminating between the sediment sources in the study area. Using a stable isotope mixing model, the median contribution from rangeland, orchard and stream bank sources was 20.8\%, 11.2\% and 68\%, respectively. Sediment source fingerprinting was used to explore the uncertainty in the contributions of sediment from the three sources. Uncertainty is considerable, as the range of probable values was wide: 2\textendash{}24\% for rangeland, 1\textendash{}26\% for orchards and 66\textendash{}83\% for stream banks respectively. While these results can be useful as a scientific basis of sediment management and selecting the soil erosion control methods for decision makers of natural resources they also show that it may not always be possible to identify sediment sources with great precision. Consequently, uncertainty needs to be accounted for when evaluating different management options.},

  abstract = {Interpretation of fishery-dependent and independent-survey data requires accounting for changes in the proportion of local individuals that are caught by fishing gear (``catchability''). Catchability may be influenced by measured characteristics of fishing gear, and even standardized fishing techniques may experience changing catchability over time due to changes in fishing vessel characteristics and personnel. The importance of vessel power has long been recognized in the analysis of fishery dependent catch per unit effort data, but less-studied in the analysis of fishery independent data collected by research vessel surveys. Here we demonstrate how differences in catchability among vessels (``vessel effects''), as well as random variation in vessel-specific catchability over time (``vessel-year effects'') can be incorporated into generalized linear mixed models through their treatment as random effects. We apply these methods to data for 28 groundfish species caught in a standardized survey using contracted fishery vessels and personnel in the Northeast Pacific. Model selection shows that vessel, vessel-year, and both effects simultaneously are supported by available data for at least a few species. However, vessel-year effects generally have a larger effect on catch rates than vessel-effects and hence abundance indices estimated using both vessel- and vessel-year effects are generally similar to estimates when using just vessel-year effects. Additionally, models indicate little support for the hypothesis that characteristics such as length and displacement of the contracted vessels used in this survey have a substantial impact on catch rates. Finally, inclusion of vessel- or vessel-year effects generally results in wider estimates of credible intervals for resulting indices of abundance. This increased credible interval width is consistent with statistical theory, because vessel effects will result in non-independence of different sampling occasions, thus decreasing effective sample sizes. For this reason, we advocate that future analyses include vessel- and/or vessel-year effects when standardizing survey data from cooperative research programs.},

  abstract = {Short-term forecasts based on time series of counts or survey data are widely used in population biology to provide advice concerning the management, harvest and conservation of natural populations. A common approach to produce these forecasts uses time-series models, of different types, fit to time series of counts. Similar time-series models are used in many other disciplines, however relative to the data available in these other disciplines, population data are often unusually short and noisy and models that perform well for data from other disciplines may not be appropriate for population data. In order to study the performance of time-series forecasting models for natural animal population data, we assembled 2379 time series of vertebrate population indices from actual surveys. Our data were comprised of three vastly different types: highly variable (marine fish productivity), strongly cyclic (adult salmon counts), and small variance but long-memory (bird and mammal counts). We tested the predictive performance of 49 different forecasting models grouped into three broad classes: autoregressive time-series models, non-linear regression-type models and non-parametric time-series models. Low-dimensional parametric autoregressive models gave the most accurate forecasts across a wide range of taxa; the most accurate model was one that simply treated the most recent observation as the forecast. More complex parametric and non-parametric models performed worse, except when applied to highly cyclic species. Across taxa, certain life history characteristics were correlated with lower forecast error; specifically, we found that better forecasts were correlated with attributes of slow growing species: large maximum age and size for fishes and high trophic level for birds. Synthesis Evaluating the data support for multiple plausible models has been an integral focus of many ecological analyses. However, the most commonly used tools to quantify support have weighted models' hindcasting and forecasting abilities. For many applications, predicting the past may be of little interest. Concentrating only on the future predictive performance of time series models, we performed a forecasting competition among many different kinds of statistical models, applying each to many different kinds of vertebrate time series of population abundance. Low-dimensional (simple) models performed well overall, but more complex models did slightly better when applied to time series of cyclic species (e.g. salmon).},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of abundance are imperative for successful conservation and management. Classical, stratified abundance estimators provide unbiased estimates of abundance, but such estimators may be imprecise and impede assessment of population status and trend when the distribution of individuals is highly variable in space. Model-based procedures that account for important environmental covariates can improve overall precision, but frequently there is uncertainty about the contribution of particular environmental variables and a lack of information about variables that are important determinants of abundance. We develop a general semiparametric mixture model that incorporates measured habitat variables and a nonparametric smoothing term to account for unmeasured variables. We contrast this spatial habitat approach with two stratified abundance estimators and compare the three models using an intensively managed marine fish, darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri).

  abstract = {Over the last century, Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha populations in the Pacific Northwest have experienced dramatic declines, leading to many of them being listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The abundance of these threatened populations relative to the thresholds for delisting remains the primary metric for assessing recovery, yet determining the true population abundances from multiple survey types with unknown levels of accuracy and precision remains difficult. The abundance of the spring\textendash{}summer Chinook Salmon population in Johnson Creek, Idaho, has been measured using a mark\textendash{}recapture survey and three different redd count surveys (RCSs) that vary temporally and spatially. Using a state-space model, we determined the accuracy and precision of each survey type by decoupling the observation error of the survey from the process error describing the annual variability in the true population abundance. We then extended the results of the model to determine the risk of managers' incorrectly delisting the population (a type I error) or incorrectly keeping it listed (a type II error). Finally, we show that salmon managers with data-limited populations (primarily those with only single-pass index RCSs) might use the results of our risk analysis to determine whether expanding survey efforts to minimize management risks is appropriate when they are confronted with dwindling financial resources. For example, we determined that although both the multiple-pass extended RCS (CV = 0.06) and mark\textendash{}recapture surveys (CV = 0.14) provide unbiased estimates of salmon abundance in Johnson Creek, the mark\textendash{}recapture study can have annual costs that are 30\textendash{}100 times greater. Managers may determine that directing research funds toward acquiring information unique to weir-based mark\textendash{}recapture surveys (i.e., migration timing, good genetics samples, etc.) may not be justified for all populations.Received October 7, 2013; accepted March 5, 2014},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis has been an integral tool for fisheries researchers since the late 1990s. However, there remain few guidelines for the design, implementation or interpretation of meta-analyses in the field of fisheries. Here, we provide the necessary background for readers, authors and reviewers, including a brief history of the use of meta-analysis in fisheries, an overview of common model types and distinctions, and examples of different goals that can be achieved using meta-analysis. We outline the primary challenges in implementing meta-analyses, including difficulties in discriminating between alternative hypotheses that can explain the data with equal plausibility, the importance of validating results using multiple lines of evidence, the trade-off between complexity and sample size and problems associated with the use of model output. For each of these challenges, we also provide suggestions, such as the use of propensity scores for dealing with selection bias and the use of covariates to control for confounding effects. These challenges are then illustrated with examples from diverse subfields of fisheries, including (i) the analysis of the stock\textendash{}recruit relationship, (ii) fisheries management, rebuilding and population viability, (iii) habitat-specific vital rates, (iv) life-history theory and (v) the evaluation of marine reserves. We conclude with our reasons for believing that meta-analysis will continue to grow in importance for these and many other research goals in fisheries science and argue that standards of practice are therefore essential.},

  doi = {10.1890/14-0739.1},
  abstract = {Identifying the existence and magnitude of density dependence is one of the oldest concerns in ecology. Ecologists have aimed to estimate density dependence in population and community data by fitting a simple autoregressive (Gompertz) model for density dependence to time series of abundance for an entire population. However, it is increasingly recognized that spatial heterogeneity in population densities has implications for population and community dynamics. We therefore adapt the Gompertz model to approximate local densities over continuous space instead of population-wide abundance, and allow productivity to vary spatially using Gaussian random fields. We then show that the conventional (nonspatial) Gompertz model can result in biased estimates of density dependence (e.g., identifying oscillatory dynamics when not present) if densities vary spatially. By contrast, the spatial Gompertz model provides accurate and precise estimates of density dependence for a variety of simulation scenarios and data availabilities. These results are corroborated when comparing spatial and nonspatial models for data from 10 years and \textasciitilde{}100 sampling stations for three long-lived rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the California, USA coast. In this case, the nonspatial model estimates implausible oscillatory dynamics on an annual time scale, while the spatial model estimates strong autocorrelation and is supported by model selection tools. We conclude by discussing the importance of improved data archiving techniques, so that spatial models can be used to reexamine classic questions regarding the existence and magnitude of density dependence in wild populations.},

Our dataset, the Puget Sound Seabird Survey of the Seattle Audubon Society, is unique in that it represents a seven-year study, collected with a focus on winter months (October\textendash{}April).

  doi = {10.1093/icesjms/fsu243},
  abstract = {Indices of abundance are the bedrock for stock assessments or empirical management procedures used to manage fishery catches for fish populations worldwide, and are generally obtained by processing catch-rate data. Recent research suggests that geostatistical models can explain a substantial portion of variability in catch rates via the location of samples (i.e. whether located in high- or low-density habitats), and thus use available catch-rate data more efficiently than conventional ``design-based'' or stratified estimators. However, the generality of this conclusion is currently unknown because geostatistical models are computationally challenging to simulation-test and have not previously been evaluated using multiple species. We develop a new maximum likelihood estimator for geostatistical index standardization, which uses recent improvements in estimation for Gaussian random fields. We apply the model to data for 28 groundfish species off the U.S. West Coast and compare results to a previous ``stratified'' index standardization model, which accounts for spatial variation using post-stratification of available data. This demonstrates that the stratified model generates a relative index with 60\% larger estimation intervals than the geostatistical model. We also apply both models to simulated data and demonstrate (i) that the geostatistical model has well-calibrated confidence intervals (they include the true value at approximately the nominal rate), (ii) that neither model on average under- or overestimates changes in abundance, and (iii) that the geostatistical model has on average 20\% lower estimation errors than a stratified model. We therefore conclude that the geostatistical model uses survey data more efficiently than the stratified model, and therefore provides a more cost-efficient treatment for historical and ongoing fish sampling data.},

Many migrants move among discrete habitats using environmental cues to time their arrivals with seasonal peaks in food abundance. This type of migratory behaviour has been hypothesized to be particularly vulnerable to climate change, which can generate asynchrony between the seasonal timing (phenology) of animal movements and periods of resource abundance in destination habitats.

* While many studies have documented climate-induced mismatches between migrants and the lower trophic levels they target, virtually none have explored the consequences of altered migration phenology on the higher trophic levels that migrants often subsidise. We explored the roles of climatic variation and prey migrations in driving the seasonal migrations of predators.

* We show that in a warming catchment where prey migrations have changed substantially over the last 4 decades, migrations of Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) (predator) remain synchronised with annually variable Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) (prey) migrations and appear to be cued directly by salmon migration rather than environmental conditions.

We analyzed stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen collected from 32 seals and 248 prey samples representing 18 of 25 of the most common seal prey items identified in seal scat. Stable isotope analyses identified significant harbor seal sex- and size-based differences in diet and foraging habitat use. In comparison to males, female harbor seals had a higher contribution of prey items that were more 13C-enriched. This result may indicate that females derived more of their $\delta$13C value from nearshore versus offshore food webs, an explanation supported by movement data on this population. However, large seals of both sexes displayed a greater offshore signal in their diet, indicating that seal mass effects on foraging habitat use were somewhat independent of sex. Our work contributes to understanding trophic linkages between these generalist consumers and their prey. The foraging differences that we detected between male and female harbor seals present complex challenges for fisheries management and for the design of marine reserves. Many marine reserves in the Pacific Northwest are located in close proximity to seal haul-out sites. By lowering the energetic costs of foraging of females, these reserves may ultimately have the unintended effect of increasing individual fitness, population growth rate, and influencing future predator-induced mortality on endangered species.},

  abstract = {Identifying spatiotemporal hotspots is important for understanding basic ecological processes, but is particularly important for species at risk. A number of terrestrial and aquatic species are indirectly affected by anthropogenic impacts, simply because they tend to be associated with species that are targeted for removals. Using newly developed statistical models that allow for the inclusion of time-varying spatial effects, we examine how the co-occurrence of a targeted and nontargeted species can be modeled as a function of environmental covariates (temperature, depth) and interannual variability. The nontarget species in our case study (eulachon) is listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and is encountered by fisheries off the U.S. West Coast that target pink shrimp. Results from our spatiotemporal model indicated that eulachon bycatch risk decreases with depth and has a convex relationship with sea surface temperature. Additionally, we found that over the 2007\textendash{}2012 period, there was support for an increase in eulachon density from both a fishery data set (+40\%) and a fishery-independent data set (+55\%). Eulachon bycatch has increased in recent years, but the agreement between these two data sets implies that increases in bycatch are not due to an increase in incidental targeting of eulachon by fishing vessels, but because of an increasing population size of eulachon. Based on our results, the application of spatiotemporal models to species that are of conservation concern appears promising in identifying the spatial distribution of environmental and anthropogenic risks to the population.},

  abstract = {It is widely assumed that rates of dispersal in animal populations are plastic in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cues, yet the factors influencing this plasticity are rarely known. This knowledge gap is surprising given the important role of dispersal in facilitating range shifts that may allow populations to persist in a rapidly changing global climate. We used two decades of tagging and recapture data from 19 hatchery populations of Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Chinook salmon) in the Columbia River, USA, to quantify the effects of regional and local climate conditions, density dependence, watershed features such as area and position on the landscape, and direct anthropogenic influence on dispersal rates by adult salmon during the breeding season. We found that the probability of dispersal, termed ``straying'' in salmon, is plastic in response to multiple factors and that populations showed varied responses that were largely idiosyncratic. A regional climate index (Pacific Decadal Oscillation), water temperatures in the mainstem Columbia River that was commonly experience by populations during migration, water temperatures in local subbasins unique to each population during the breeding season, migration distance, and density dependence had the strongest effects on dispersal. Patterns of dispersal plasticity in response to commonly experienced conditions were consistent with gene by environment interactions, though we are tentative about this interpretation given the domesticated history of these populations. Overall, our results warn against attempts to predict future range shifts of migratory species without considering population-specific dispersal plasticity, and also caution against the use of few populations to infer species-level patterns. Ultimately, our results provide evidence that analyses that examine the response of dispersal to single factors may be misleading.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0129723},
  abstract = {We modified the stable isotope mixing model MixSIR to infer primary producer contributions to consumer diets based on their fatty acid composition. To parameterize the algorithm, we generated a `consumer-resource library' of FA signatures of Daphnia fed different algal diets, using 34 feeding trials representing diverse phytoplankton lineages. This library corresponds to the resource or producer file in classic Bayesian mixing models such as MixSIR or SIAR. Because this library is based on the FA profiles of zooplankton consuming known diets, and not the FA profiles of algae directly, trophic modification of consumer lipids is directly accounted for. To test the model, we simulated hypothetical Daphnia comprised of 80\% diatoms, 10\% green algae, and 10\% cryptophytes and compared the FA signatures of these known pseudo-mixtures to outputs generated by the mixing model. The algorithm inferred these simulated consumers were comprised of 82\% (63-92\%) [median (2.5th to 97.5th percentile credible interval)] diatoms, 11\% (4-22\%) green algae, and 6\% (0-25\%) cryptophytes. We used the same model with published phytoplankton stable isotope (SI) data for $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N to examine how a SI based approach resolved a similar scenario. With SI, the algorithm inferred that the simulated consumer assimilated 52\% (4-91\%) diatoms, 23\% (1-78\%) green algae, and 18\% (1-73\%) cyanobacteria. The accuracy and precision of SI based estimates was extremely sensitive to both resource and consumer uncertainty, as well as the trophic fractionation assumption. These results indicate that when using only two tracers with substantial uncertainty for the putative resources, as is often the case in this class of analyses, the underdetermined constraint in consumer-resource SI analyses may be intractable. The FA based approach alleviated the underdetermined constraint because many more FA biomarkers were utilized (n $<$ 20), different primary producers (e.g., diatoms, green algae, and cryptophytes) have very characteristic FA compositions, and the FA profiles of many aquatic primary consumers are strongly influenced by their diets.},

  abstract = {Predators are critical components of ecosystems. Globally, conservation efforts have targeted depleted populations of top predators for legal protection, and in many cases, this protection has helped their recoveries. Where the recovery of individual species is the goal, these efforts can be seen as largely successful. From an ecosystem perspective, however, predator recovery can introduce significant new conservation and legal challenges. We highlight three types of conflicts created by a single-species focus: (1) recovering predator populations that increase competition with humans for the same prey, (2) new tradeoffs that emerge when protected predators consume protected prey, and (3) multiple predator populations that compete for the same limited prey. We use two food webs with parallel conservation challenges, the Northeast Pacific Ocean and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, to demonstrate legal/policy conflicts and the policy levers that exist to ameliorate conflicts. In some cases, scientific uncertainty about the ecological interaction hinders progress towards resolving conflicts. In others, available policy options are insufficient. In all cases, management decisions must be made in the face of an unknown future. We suggest a framework that incorporates multispecies science, policy tools, and tradeoff analyses into management.},

Many SDMs have been developed over the past decades, with a focus on space- and more recently, time-dependence. However, most of these studies have been on terrestrial species and applications to marine species have been limited. In this study, we used three large spatio-temporal data sources (habitat maps, survey-based fish density estimates, and fishery catch data) and a novel space-time model to study how the distribution of fishing may affect the seasonal dynamics of a commercially important fish species (Pacific Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus) off the west coast of the USA. Dover sole showed a large scale change in seasonal and annual distribution of biomass, and its distribution shifted from mid-depth zones to inshore or deeper waters during late summer/early fall. In many cases, the scale of fishery removal was small compared to these broader changes in biomass, suggesting that seasonal dynamics were primarily driven by movement and not by fishing. The increasing availability of appropriate data and space-time modeling software should facilitate extending this work to many other species, particularly those in marine ecosystems, and help tease apart the role of growth, natural mortality, recruitment, movement, and fishing on spatial patterns of species distribution in marine systems.},

Prey has the ability to synchronize predators if geographically isolated predator populations target the same prey species, or if the migration and range of the prey species occurs over a large enough scale to be available to multiple predator populations. The objective of our study was to investigate evidence for correlations of demographic rates between geographically isolated populations of piscivorous killer whales in the Northeast Pacific; using long-term mark-recapture datasets collected over the last 30+~yrs, we constructed a hierarchical occupancy model, linking models of survival and fecundity in a single framework. We found strong support for synchronized demographic rates in Southeast Alaska and Southern Resident killer whales, which are geographically and reproductively isolated. Despite their isolation, they experience extremely correlated dynamics\textemdash{}the correlation in fecundity rates between populations exceeds 0.9. The correlation in demographic rates across these populations of killer whales in different regions of the Northeast Pacific Ocean suggests a common environmental driver. Both killer whale populations are known to prey on Chinook salmon, which have a long-distance coastal migration larger than the habitat range of killer whales. Many of these Chinook salmon are also of the same origin (southern stocks), suggesting that these populations not only consume the same prey species but the same prey populations.},

  doi = {10.1002/ece3.2031},
  abstract = {For species of conservation concern, an essential part of the recovery planning process is identifying discrete population units and their location with respect to one another. A common feature among geographically proximate populations is that the number of organisms tends to covary through time as a consequence of similar responses to exogenous influences. In turn, high covariation among populations can threaten the persistence of the larger metapopulation. Historically, explorations of the covariance in population size of species with many ($>$10) time series have been computationally difficult. Here, we illustrate how dynamic factor analysis (DFA) can be used to characterize diversity among time series of population abundances and the degree to which all populations can be represented by a few common signals. Our application focuses on anadromous Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a species listed under the US Endangered Species Act, that is impacted by a variety of natural and anthropogenic factors. Specifically, we fit DFA models to 24 time series of population abundance and used model selection to identify the minimum number of latent variables that explained the most temporal variation after accounting for the effects of environmental covariates. We found support for grouping the time series according to 5 common latent variables. The top model included two covariates: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in spring and summer. The assignment of populations to the latent variables matched the currently established population structure at a broad spatial scale. At a finer scale, there was more population grouping complexity. Some relatively distant populations were grouped together, and some relatively close populations \textendash{} considered to be more aligned with each other \textendash{} were more associated with populations further away. These coarse- and fine-grained examinations of spatial structure are important because they reveal different structural patterns not evident in other analyses.},

  doi = {10.1111/2041-210X.12567},
  abstract = {* Changing climate is already impacting the spatial distribution of many taxa, including bees, plants, birds, butterflies and fishes. A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity, COG), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (AWA) estimator for COG, confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time. AWA also does not estimate the standard error of COG in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs.

* To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (SDF) estimator. The SDF approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including COG, population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the SDF approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an r package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the SDF substantially decreases bias in COG estimates relative to the AWA estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977\textendash{}2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast.

* In our case study, the SDF estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between AWA and SDF estimates of COG that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the AWA but not the SDF estimator).

* We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.},

  abstract = {As many marine mammal populations have increased following bans on their harvest, there has been a growing need to understand potential impacts of these population changes on coastal marine ecosystems. Quantifying consumption of prey species, such as fish, is particularly important when those same prey are also targeted by commercial fisheries. Estimating the impact of marine mammal predators on prey fish depends upon knowledge of marine mammal diet composition; scientific advances over the last century have improved understanding of diets but have also led to inconsistent methods that challenge attempts at synthesis and comparison. Meta-analysis techniques offer the opportunity to overcome such challenges, yet have not been widely applied to synthesize marine mammal diets over space and time. As a case study, we focus on synthesizing diet studies of Chinook (king) salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) by four species of marine mammal predators in the Northeast Pacific Ocean: Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), and killer whales (Orcinus orca). We also highlight several simple meta-analyses for which these types of diet databases may be employed. Our assembled database consists of $>$330 records, spanning more than 100years. Results indicate that the frequency of occurrence of Chinook salmon in killer whale studies is high (63\%) relative to pinniped studies ($<$10\%). They also suggest a strong increasing ability to discriminate Chinook salmon from other salmonids, which we attribute to switches in diet studies from lethal or observational sampling toward molecular methods (DNA, fatty acids). Our database and analysis code are published as supplementary material, which we hope will be useful for other researchers and will inspire more of these syntheses.},

This ``trophic downgrading'' has generated widespread concern because of the fundamental role that apex predators can play in ecosystem functioning, disease regulation, and biodiversity maintenance. In attempts to combat declines, managers have conducted reintroductions, imposed stricter harvest regulations, and implemented protected areas. We suggest that full recovery of viable apex predator populations is currently the exception rather than the rule. We argue that, in addition to well-known considerations, such as continued exploitation and slow life histories, there are several underappreciated factors that complicate predator recoveries. These factors include three challenges. First, a priori identification of the suite of trophic interactions, such as resource limitation and competition that will influence recovery can be difficult. Second, defining and accomplishing predator recovery in the context of a dynamic ecosystem requires an appreciation of the timing of recovery, which can determine the relative density of apex predators and other predators and therefore affect competitive outcomes. Third, successful recovery programs require designing adaptive sequences of management strategies that embrace key environmental and species interactions as they emerge. Consideration of recent research on food web modules, alternative stable states, and community assembly offer important insights for predator recovery efforts and restoration ecology more generally. Foremost among these is the importance of a social-ecological perspective in facilitating a long-lasting predator restoration while avoiding unintended consequences.
Variable life histories, species interactions, and historical contingency underlie why some predators recover and others do not.

  abstract = {As climate change increases maximal water temperatures, behavioural thermoregulation may be crucial for the persistence of coldwater fishes, such as salmonids. Although myriad studies have documented behavioural thermoregulation in southern populations of salmonids, few if any have explored this phenomenon in northern populations, which are less likely to have an evolutionary history of heat stress, yet are predicted to experience substantial warming. Here, we treated a rare heat wave as a natural experiment to test whether wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) at the northern extent of their primary range (60$^\circ$ latitude) can thermoregulate in response to abnormally high thermal conditions. We tagged adult sockeye salmon with temperature loggers as they staged in a lake epilimnion prior to spawning in small cold streams (n~=~40 recovered loggers). As lake surface temperatures warmed to physiologically suboptimal levels (15\textendash{}20$^\circ$C), sockeye salmon thermoregulated by moving to tributary plumes or the lake metalimnion. A regression of fish body temperature against lake surface temperature indicated that fish moved to cooler waters when the epilimnion temperature exceeded \textasciitilde{}12$^\circ$C. A bioenergetics model suggested that the observed behaviour reduced daily metabolic costs by as much as \textasciitilde{}50\% during the warmest conditions (18\textendash{}20$^\circ$C). These results provide rare evidence of cool-seeking thermoregulation at the poleward extent of a species range, emphasizing the potential ubiquity of maximal temperature constraints and the functional significance of thermal heterogeneity for buffering poikilotherms from climate change.},

These data pose several statistical challenges for analysis and estimation that have hindered our ability to create quantitative diet fraction estimates from stomach content data. To address these challenges, we developed a novel, likelihood-based mixture model to quantitatively estimate diet fractions.

The recovery of many marine mammal populations on the west coast of the United States has been viewed as a success; however, within Puget Sound in Washington State, the increased abundance of three protected pinniped species may be adversely affecting the recovery of threatened Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and endangered killer whales (Orcinus orca) within the region.

  abstract = {Mechanisms driving selection of body size and growth rate in wild marine vertebrates are poorly understood, thus limiting knowledge of their fitness costs at ecological, physiological and genetic scales. Here, we indirectly tested whether selection for size-related traits of juvenile sharks that inhabit a nursery hosting two dichotomous habitats, protected mangroves (low predation risk) and exposed seagrass beds (high predation risk), is influenced by their foraging behaviour. Juvenile sharks displayed a continuum of foraging strategies between mangrove and seagrass areas, with some individuals preferentially feeding in one habitat over another. Foraging habitat was correlated with growth rate, whereby slower growing, smaller individuals fed predominantly in sheltered mangroves, whereas larger, faster growing animals fed over exposed seagrass. Concomitantly, tracked juveniles undertook variable movement behaviours across both the low and high predation risk habitat. These data provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis that directional selection favouring smaller size and slower growth rate, both heritable traits in this shark population, may be driven by variability in foraging behaviour and predation risk. Such evolutionary pathways may be critical to adaptation within predator-driven marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The Exxon Valdez oil spill occurred in March 1989 in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and was one of the worst environmental disasters on record in the United States. Despite long-term data collection over the nearly three decades since the spill, tremendous uncertainty remains as to how significantly the spill affected fishery resources. Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and some wild Pacific salmon populations (Oncorhynchus spp.) in Prince William Sound declined in the early 1990s, and have not returned to the population sizes observed in the 1980s. Discerning if, or how much of, this decline resulted from the oil spill has been difficult because a number of other physical and ecological drivers are confounded temporally with the spill; some of these drivers include environmental variability or changing climate regimes, increased production of hatchery salmon in the region, and increases in populations of potential predators. Using data pre- and post-spill, we applied time-series methods to evaluate support for whether and how herring and salmon productivity has been affected by each of five drivers: (1) density dependence, (2) the EVOS event, (3) changing environmental conditions, (4) interspecific competition on juvenile fish, and (5) predation and competition from adult fish or, in the case of herring, humpback whales. Our results showed support for intraspecific density-dependent effects in herring, sockeye, and Chinook salmon, with little overall support for an oil spill effect. Of the salmon species, the largest driver was the negative impact of adult pink salmon returns on sockeye salmon productivity. Herring productivity was most strongly affected by changing environmental conditions; specifically, freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska was linked to a series of recruitment failures\textemdash{}before, during, and after EVOS. These results highlight the need to better understand long terms impacts of pink salmon on food webs, as well as the interactions between nearshore species and freshwater inputs, particularly as they relate to climate change and increasing water temperatures.},

  abstract = {Ecological indicators are often collected to detect and monitor environmental change. Statistical models are used to estimate natural variability, pre-existing trends, and environmental predictors of baseline indicator conditions. Establishing standard models for baseline characterization is critical to the effective design and implementation of environmental monitoring programs. An anthropogenic activity that requires monitoring is the development of Marine Renewable Energy sites. Currently, there are no standards for the analysis of environmental monitoring data for these development sites. Marine Renewable Energy monitoring data are used as a case study to develop and apply a model evaluation to establish best practices for characterizing baseline ecological indicator data. We examined a range of models, including six generalized regression models, four time series models, and three nonparametric models. Because monitoring data are not always normally distributed, we evaluated model ability to characterize normal and non-normal data using hydroacoustic metrics that serve as proxies for ecological indicator data. The nonparametric support vector regression and random forest models, and parametric state-space time series models generally were the most accurate in interpolating the normal metric data. Support vector regression and state-space models best interpolated the non-normally distributed data. If parametric results are preferred, then state-space models are the most robust for baseline characterization. Evaluation of a wide range of models provides a comprehensive characterization of the case study data, and highlights advantages of models rarely used in Marine Renewable Energy environmental monitoring. Our model findings are relevant for any ecological indicator data with similar properties, and the evaluation approach is applicable to any monitoring program.},

  abstract = {Individuals relying on natural resource extraction for their livelihood face high income variability driven by a mix of environmental, biological, management, and economic factors. Key to managing these industries is identifying how regulatory actions and individual behavior affect income variability, financial risk, and, by extension, the economic stability and the sustainable use of natural resources. In commercial fisheries, communities and vessels fishing a greater diversity of species have less revenue variability than those fishing fewer species. However, it is unclear whether these benefits extend to the actions of individual fishers and how year-to-year changes in diversification affect revenue and revenue variability. Here, we evaluate two axes by which fishers in Alaska can diversify fishing activities. We show that, despite increasing specialization over the last 30 years, fishing a set of permits with higher species diversity reduces individual revenue variability, and fishing an additional permit is associated with higher revenue and lower variability. However, increasing species diversity within the constraints of existing permits has a fishery-dependent effect on revenue and is usually (87\% probability) associated with increased revenue uncertainty the following year. Our results demonstrate that the most effective option for individuals to decrease revenue variability is to participate in additional or more diverse fisheries. However, this option is expensive, often limited by regulations such as catch share programs, and consequently unavailable to many individuals. With increasing climatic variability, it will be particularly important that individuals relying on natural resources for their livelihood have effective strategies to reduce financial risk.},

A large body of work has explored what happens when coevolved species shift out of sync, but virtually no studies have documented the effects of climate-induced synchronization, which could remove temporal barriers between species and create novel interactions. We explored how a predator, the Kodiak brown bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi), responded to asymmetric phenological shifts between its primary trophic resources, sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and red elderberry (Sambucus racemosa). In years with anomalously high spring air temperatures, elderberry fruited several weeks earlier and became available during the period when salmon spawned in tributary streams. Bears departed salmon spawning streams, where they typically kill 25\textendash{}75\% of the salmon [Quinn TP, Cunningham CJ, Wirsing AJ (2016) Oecologia 183:415\textendash{}429], to forage on berries on adjacent hillsides. This prey switching behavior attenuated an iconic predator\textendash{}prey interaction and likely altered the many ecological functions that result from bears foraging on salmon [Helfield JM, Naiman RJ (2006) Ecosystems 9:167\textendash{}180]. We document how climate-induced shifts in resource phenology can alter food webs through a mechanism other than trophic mismatch. The current emphasis on singular consumer-resource interactions fails to capture how climate-altered phenologies reschedule resource availability and alter how energy flows through ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Many marine mammal predators, particularly pinnipeds, have increased in abundance in recent decades, generating new challenges for balancing human uses with recovery goals via ecosystem-based management. We used a spatio-temporal bioenergetics model of the Northeast Pacific Ocean to quantify how predation by three species of pinnipeds and killer whales (Orcinus orca) on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has changed since the 1970s along the west coast of North America, and compare these estimates to salmon fisheries. We find that from 1975 to 2015, biomass of Chinook salmon consumed by pinnipeds and killer whales increased from 6,100 to 15,200 metric tons (from 5 to 31.5 million individual salmon). Though there is variation across the regions in our model, overall, killer whales consume the largest biomass of Chinook salmon, but harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) consume the largest number of individuals. The decrease in adult Chinook salmon harvest from 1975\textendash{}2015 was 16,400 to 9,600 metric tons. Thus, Chinook salmon removals (harvest\,+\,consumption) increased in the past 40 years despite catch reductions by fisheries, due to consumption by recovering pinnipeds and endangered killer whales. Long-term management strategies for Chinook salmon will need to consider potential conflicts between rebounding predators or endangered predators and prey.},

  abstract = {* Theory and previous studies have shown that commercial fishers with a diversified catch across multiple species may experience benefits such as increased revenue and reduced variability in revenue. However, fishers can only increase the species diversity of their catch if they own fishing permits that allow multiple species to be targeted, or if they own multiple single-species permits. Individuals holding a single permit can only increase catch diversity within the confines of their permit (e.g. by fishing longer or over a broader spatial area).

* Using a large dataset of individual salmon fishers in Alaska, we build a Bayesian variance function regression model to understand how diversification impacts revenue and revenue variability, and how these effects have evolved since the 1970s.

* Applying these models to six salmon fisheries that encompass a broad geographic range and a variety of harvesting methods and species, we find that the majority of these fisheries have experienced reduced catch diversity through time and increasing benefits of specialization on mean individual revenues.

* One factor that has been hypothesized to reduce catch diversity in salmon fisheries is large-scale hatchery production. While our results suggest negative correlations between hatchery returns and catch diversity for some fisheries, we find little evidence for a change in variability of annual catches associated with increased hatchery production.

* Synthesis and applications. Despite general trends towards more specialization among commercial fishers in Alaska, and more fishers exclusively targeting salmon, we find that catching fewer species can have positive effects on revenue. With increasing specialization, it is important to understand how individuals buffer against risk, as well as any barriers that prevent diversification. In addition to being affected by environmental variability, fishers are also affected by economic factors including demand and prices offered by processors. Life-history variation in the species targeted may also play a role. Individuals participating in Alaskan fisheries with high contributions of pink salmon \textemdash{} which have the shortest life cycles of all Pacific salmon \textemdash{} also have the highest variability in year-to-year revenue.},
